RISC-V assembly
Q: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: a0, a1, a2(holds 13)

Q: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: There's no such call. g is inline in f, and f is inline in main.

Q: At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x0000000000000630

Q: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x38, ra is the return address register. 
   jalr will write the following instruction address(pc+4) into the register. When the function returns, pc points to the address in ra.
